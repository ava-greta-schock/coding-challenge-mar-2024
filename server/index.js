Welcome to the backend of your application! Here are some steps you can follow to get your backend up and running!

2. Create folders for your backend code (repositories, controllers, models, etc.)
    a. ASK GITHUB COPILOT! ("How do I structure my backend code?")
    
3. Create a database and connect it to your backend (SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)
    a. ASK GITHUB COPILOT! ("How do I connect my backend to a database?", "Generate models based off the given JSON")

4. Create a RESTful API that connects your backend to your frontend (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests)
    a. ASK GITHUB COPILOT! ("How do I create a RESTful API?", "Generate code for a RESTful API endpoint")

5. Test your API using Postman or a similar tool
    a. ASK GITHUB COPILOT! ("How do I test my API using Postman?")

6. Connect your backend to your frontend using the API endpoints you created
    a. ASK GITHUB COPILOT! ("How do I connect my backend to my frontend?")
