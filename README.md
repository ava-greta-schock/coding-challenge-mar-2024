<h2 align="center">Instructions</h2>

The purpose of March's Coding Challenge is to familiarize yourself with GitHub's Copilot Tool. Reach out to [Andrew Roubin](mailto:andrew.roubin@avanade.com) to be added to the [Avanade-Region-USWest](https://github.com/Avanade-Region-USWest) group in order to gain access to Copilot.

You can access NASA's Asteroids - NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service) API [here](https://api.nasa.gov/)

1. Start in the server/index.js file and follow the instructions to create your backend structure using Copilot.

2. Once you have completed Step 1, continue to client/index.js and follow the instructions to create your frontend using Copilot.

3. If you have not done so already, connect your frontend to your backend to create a fullstack application. At this point, you should have a working NASA's Asteroids - NeoWs app. (NOTE: Here is where you can get creative. What would you like to build to better this application?)

5. Fully test your application for functionality and accessibility.

6. Deploy your application.
